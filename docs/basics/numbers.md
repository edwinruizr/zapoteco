Cajonos Zapoteco variation

:::

The numbers in Zapoteco are difficult to learn as they are not base 10 like we are used to. 
Note that the key is twentieth, the numerals from 1 to 20 are repeated, from 21 to 39 the terms (_chhua_ and _echhua_) 
are added to the numerals, from 41 to 59 (_eyun_ and _yun_), from 61 to 79 (gayun), and from 81 to 99 (taplaj), in these 
last two scores, the terms are placed before the numerals as can be seen in the table[^1].

Hundreds are formed by saying the multiplier digit before the word for hundred (gayua):

- tu gayua [100]
- chup gayua [200]
- shun gayua [300]
- shi gayua [1000]
