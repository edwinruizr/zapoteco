Verbs are the powerhouse of language, as they convey the action, occurrence, or state of being within a sentence. They
provide the dynamic element that drives a message forward, allowing us to express not only what happens but also when it
happens (tense) and how it happens (mood and voice). Verbs enable us to paint a vivid and complete picture of events and
experiences, making them vital for effective communication and storytelling in any language.
